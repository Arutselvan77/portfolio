			I can honestly say that my time spent interning with Herbein and 
            Company resulted in one of the best<br> summers of my life.Not only did 
            I gain practical skills but I also had the opportunity to meet many 
            fantastic<br> people.The atmosphere at the Pittsburgh office was always 
            welcoming which made me feel right at home. <br>Additionally, I felt like I
            was able to contribute to the company by assisting and working on 
            projects<br> throughout the summer.
